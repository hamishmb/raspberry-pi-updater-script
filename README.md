# Raspberry Pi Updater Script

A simple Raspberry Pi updater script I created to be run by cron for easy automatic updates and housekeeping.

**NOTE:** I made this for my own convenience, and decided to share it here in case it's useful for anyone else. If at some point I don't need it, I make no prmise to maintain it and/or add new features.

Merge requests for features and fixes are welcome.
